# POGO Event Scheduler
This chrome extension serves as a way to automatically schedule Google Calendar Events of various Pokemon GO events posts by Leek Duck [here](https://leekduck.com/events/).

# Installation
Find it here on Chrome Web Store! (*WIP*)

# Usage
*Probably a button on each Leek Duck event that automatically adds it to your calendar or something*

# Images
*Eventual images showing what the extension adds*

# Reason for Creation
I'm wayyyy too lazy to make GCal events myself each and every time theres an event I want to track, and I don't want those calendars with EVERY SINGLE event cuz theres some I really don't care about (Forces of Nature/Genies). I'm also super obsessed with Pokemon GO rn so that's the main reason why I'm doin all this!
